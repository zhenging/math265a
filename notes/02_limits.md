### 02 Limits

#### 2.1 The Idea of Limits
+ Average Velocity: $v_{av} = \frac{s(t_1) - s(t_0)}{t_1-t_0}$
+ Instantaneous Velocity: $v_{inst} = \dlim_{t \to t_0}v_{av}$
+ Slope of the Tangent Line: $m_{tan} = \dlim_{t \to t_0}m_{sec}$

#### 2.2 Definitions of Limits
+ Limit of a Function (Arbitrarily large and sufficiently close)
+ The value of $L$ (limit) depends upon the value of $f$ near $a$, but it does not depend on the value of $f(a)$.
+ Find limits from a graph and a table (_Ex1, 2_)
+ One-Sided Limits: $\dlim_{x \to a^+}f(x) = L, \dlim_{x \to a^-}f(x) = L$
+ **Relationship** Between _One-sided_ and _Two-sided_ Limits
+ Function with jumps and some strange behavior ($\dlim_{x\to 0+}\cos \frac{1}{x}$ does not exist).

#### 2.3 Techniques for Computing Limits
+ Limits of Linear Functions
+ Limits Raws, Sum, Difference, Constant Multiple, Product, Quotient, Power, Fractional Power
+ Limits of Polynomial and Rational Functions
+ One-sided Limits (Fractional Power)
+ Techniques other then direct substitution (**Algebriac manipulation**)
+ The slope of tangent line to the graphs of$f(x)=2^x$ at the point $P(0, 1)$. _($\ln 2$)_
+ The **Squeeze Theorem**

##### Examples
a.$\dlim_{x \to 2}{\dfrac{\sqrt{2x^3 + 9} + 3x -1}{4x + 1}}$ &emsp; b. $\dlim_{x \to 2}{\dfrac{x^2 -6x + 8}{x^2-4}}$ &emsp;  c. $\dlim_{x \to 1}{\dfrac{\sqrt{x} - 1}{x-1}}$
>Solution
a. $\frac{10}{9}$ &emsp; b. $-\frac{1}{2}$ &emsp; c. $\frac{1}{2}$

#### 2.4 Infinite Limits
+ Infinite Limits: $\dlim_{x \to a}f(x) = \pm \infty$. The limit does not exist.
+ One-sided Infinite Limits
+ Vertical Asymptote: $\dlim_{x \to a}f(x) = \pm \infty$, or $\dlim_{x \to a^+}f(x) = \pm \infty$, or $\dlim_{x \to a^-}f(x) = \pm \infty$.
+ Finding Infinite Limits Graphically and Analytically (_Ex2, 3_)
+ Location of vertical asymptote (_Ex5_)

#### 2.5 Limits at Infinity

+ Limits at Infinity and Horizontal Asymptote: $\dlim_{x \to \pm \infty} f(x)=L$
+ Infinite Limites at Infinity: $\dlim_{x \to \pm \infty} f(x)=\pm \infty$
+ Limits at Infinity of Powers and Polynomials
+ End behavior (_Ex3_)
+ Slant Asymptote
+ End behavior and Asymptote of Rational Functions ($f(x) = \frac{p(x)}{q(x)}$)
+ End behavior of $e^x, e^{-x}, \ln x$, (_Ex6_)

#### 2.6 Continuity
hw 53, 57

+ Continuity at a Point: $\dlim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)$
+ Continuity Checklist: $f(a)$ is defined, $\dlim_{x \to a} f(x)$ exists and $\dlim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)$.
+ Continity Rules: $f+g, f-g, fg, cf, \frac{f}{g}, (f(x))^n$
+ Polynomial and Rational Functions: $f\circ g$
+ Continuity of Composite Functions at a Point
+ Continuity at Endpoints and on an Interval
+ Continuity of Functions with Roots
+ Continuity of Inverse Functions
+ Continuity of Transcendental Functions
  + Trigonometric Functions
  + Inverse Trigonometric Functions
  + Exponential Functions
  + Logarithmic
+ Limits involing transcendental functions (_Ex7_).
+ The Intermediate Value Theorem
  + $f$ is continuous on the interval $[a, b]$
  + $f(a) \le L \le f(b)$
  + Then there is at least one number $c$ in $(a, b)$ satisfying $f(c)=L$.
+ Finding an interest rate (_Ex8_)
